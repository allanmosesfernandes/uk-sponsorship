## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in GitHub Issues at `allanmosesfernandes/uk-sponsorship`, managed via the `gh` CLI. External PRs are not a triage surface. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default canonical labels: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context layout: one `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/` at the repo root (created lazily by `/domain-modeling` when needed). See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
